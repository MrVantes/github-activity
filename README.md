Here is a README for the **GitHub Activity Tracker** (assumed to be a command-line tool for tracking GitHub events like pushes, issues, etc.):

# GitHub Activity Tracker

A command-line tool built in Golang to track your GitHub activities, such as commits, issues, pull requests, and more, for a given user.

## Installation

### Linux:

1. **Build the application**:

   ```bash
   go build -o github-activity
   ```

2. **Move the executable to `/usr/local/bin/` for system-wide access**:
   ```bash
   sudo mv github-activity /usr/local/bin/
   ```

### Windows:

For Windows, follow these steps to build and install your Go application:

1. **Build the application**:
   Open a command prompt (or PowerShell) in the directory where your Go code is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   go build -o github-activity.exe
   ```

   This will generate the `github-activity.exe` executable.

2. **Move the executable to a directory in your PATH**:
   To make the application accessible system-wide, move it to a directory that's included in your `PATH`. You can use a directory like `C:\Program Files` or `C:\Users\<your_username>\go\bin`, or choose another location.

   Use the following command to move the `github-activity.exe`:

   ```bash
   move github-activity.exe C:\path\to\desired\directory\
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   move github-activity.exe C:\Users\<your_username>\go\bin\
   ```

3. **Ensure the directory is in your PATH**:
   If the directory where you moved the executable is not already in your `PATH`, you can add it manually:

   - Right-click on `This PC` or `Computer`, and select **Properties**.
   - Click **Advanced system settings** on the left side.
   - In the **System Properties** window, click **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System variables**, scroll down and select the `Path` variable, then click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add the path to the directory where `github-activity.exe` was moved (e.g., `C:\Users\<your_username>\go\bin\`).
   - Click **OK** to save the changes.

After following these steps, you should be able to run `github-activity` from any command prompt or PowerShell window.
